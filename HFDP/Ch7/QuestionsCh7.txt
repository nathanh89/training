CHAPTER 7
----------------------------------------------------

P. 242:	How would you write a class that converts a Duck into a Turkey?
public class DuckAdapter implements Turkey{
	Turkey turkey;
	public TurkeyAdapter(Duck duck){
		this.turkey = turkey;
	}
	public void gobble(){
		duck.quack();
	}
	public void fly(){
		duck.fly(); 
	}
}

Honestly, I had no idea how to go about chopping down the duck fly method, since there wasn't an actual distance defined by this fake program. Looks like the books solution is to generate a random integer and have it fly on one randomly generated integer of 5. I think. Weird, but I guess it works in principle to shorten the flight.

P. 244:	 How does the different implementations of adapting affect the flexibility of the systems that use them (Class vs. Object adapters)
Class adapters would have to be changed any time there is change to either the Target class or the Adaptee class. Encapsulating the adapter makes it more resilient to change, and less work has to be done when other classes are modified.

P. 245:	Drag these magnets around! Show how a Class Adapter and an Object Adapter might work with the Duck-Turkey paradigm.
Class Adapter
Client (makes request to expected Class, Target)
Target puts that request forward to a subclass, Adapter, which is an extension of both the Target and Adaptee classes. I'm not sure how exactly the Target knows to push to an Adapter in this case, but apparently it does. It couldn't be that the method is abstract...I don't think, because the Target needs to have the desired method implementation in cases when an adapter is not needed...but maybe I'm overthinking again.
Adapter gets the result of the request from the class it is adapting, the Adaptee class. It then relays that back to the client through the Target class.

Object Adapter
Client makes request to target Interface.
Target interface looks for implementation in Adapter class. 
The Adapter class has the implementation, and that calls the data required by the original request from the Adaptee class.
The Adapter relays Adaptee information back to the client.

P. 251a: Write an adapter that adapts an Iterator to an Enumeration
public class IteratingEnumeration implements Enumeration{
	Iterator iterate;
	public IteratingEnumeration(Iterator iterate){
		this.iterate = iterate;		
	}
	@Override
	public boolean hasMoreElements(){
		return iterate.hasNext();
	}
	@Override
	public Object nextElement(){
		return iterate.next();
	}
}

P. 251b: Some AC adapters do more than just change the interface, sometimes they add extra features (i.e. surge protection). If you were going to implement extra features to an interface adapter, what design pattern would you use?
Well, I wouldn't want to have the features contained within the adapter, I want them in another class. I'd say the closest pattern to what I would want to do here is the Decorator Pattern. I could wrap the adapter in any number of classes to extend and otherwise add to its functionality.

P. 254:	Match each desing pattern to its intent.
Decorator - Doesn't alter the interface, but adds responsibility.
Adapter - Converts one interface to another
Facade - Makes an interface simpler

P. 262:	Think about the facades you've encountered in the Java API. Where would you like to have new ones?
Well, the only one that comes to mind so far is the Scanner. Unless I'm mistaken, it is a simplified interface for the mess of Java I/O classes. If you don't need advanced functionality, Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in) and a nice scanner.nextLine() and you've got a way to capture input. Where as without scanner, you have to do BufferedReader scanner = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)) which is way longer and uglier looking. Scanner sounds like it fits this pattern description: it's a simplified interface providing access to higher level functionality with Java I/O. As to what else I'd like to see that applied to, I'm hard pressed to say. I don't think I've got enough Java know-how to start pointing its flaws en masse at this point.

P. 265:	How many classes does the following code couple to?
public float getTemp(){
	return station.getThermometer().getTemperature();

First look, it seems to be two, at least. It looks to be interacting with a WeatherStation, and that's pulling data from a Thermometer class. I may be wrong, but ya...at least two. I think it's kind of hard to tell concretely from that code snippet anyway what all it's dependent on.

P. 268:	Do either of these code snippets violate the principle of least knowledge?
The first one certainly does, because you are calling a method of an object you got from a call done previously.
The second one isn't technically violating it...I think. Instead of calling the getTemperature() method directly on the object retrieved with getTemp(), it instead uses what amounts to an in-object alias method for the Thermometer method getTemperature(). However, it never directly calls the getTemperature() method on the Thermometer object from getTemp(), so again I think it is technically in clear for not violating the Law of Demeter.

P. 268:	Can you think of a common use of java that violates the Law of Demeter?
Well, recently I wrote a program where I kept needing to get the class names of objects I was instatiating. So I would have to do something like return getDisplay().getClass().getSimpleName() (that's not exactly it, but "you" get the idea, right?) And that's a trifecta of method calling on returned objects from prior calls! Worked though...but it certainly isn't pretty to look at. However in that particular case, I don't know that it would have been that beneficial to work in aliases to correct it. I guess that's why HFDP prefers to call it the "Princple" of Least Knowledge rather than the Law of Demeter. Sometimes it's not worth it to stringently apply it.
