This is just a quick reference for the design principles and patterns expounded upon in Head First Design Patterns.

Ch1 - Intro to Design Patterns

-Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same. (Encapsulate what varies)

-Program to an interface, not an implementation

-Favor composition over inheritance

-THE STRATEGY PATTERN: defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
