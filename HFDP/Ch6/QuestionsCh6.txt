CHAPTER 6
----------------------------------------------------

P. 202:	Match the diner objects and methods with the corresponding names from the Command Pattern.
Customer = Client
Order = Command
takeOrder() = setCommand()
Waitress = Invoker
orderUp() = execute()
Short Order Cook = Receiver

P. 205:	What would the implementation look like for GarageDoorOpenCommand?
Well, its in the code, but basically you'll set up the constructor to take in a GarageDoor, then define the execute() method to activate the desired command, in this case, up() from the GarageDoor class.

P. 207: How does the design of the Command Pattern support the decoupling of the invoker of a request and the receiver of the request?
Well, the command is created independently of its execution. Any invoker can create the command, but that command doesn't have to be and often isn't executed right away. That is up the the receiver, and since neither are really dependent on what the other is doing (The invoker and the receiver) then they are decoupled.

P. 225: Write the code for the off commands for the remote.
LightOffCommmand lightOff = new LightOffCommand(light);
StereoOffCommand stereoOff = new StereoOffCommand(stereo);
TVOffCommand tvOff = new TVOffCommand(tv);
HottubOffCommand hottubOff = new HottubOffCommand(hottub);

P. 227: Write the undo command for the MacroCommand class.
public void undo(){
for (int i = commands.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
	commands[i].undo();
}

This is so that it will iterate backwards through the array rather than forwards, because the commands need to be performed in reverse.

P. 228:	How might a web server make use of a job queue? Anything else that might that you can think of?
Honestly, I'm not a 100 percent on the web server, but I imagine, say after you login there might be a delay while you're authenticated, and in that time commands might be queued up to display your default page, present you with new notifications or messages, something along those lines. I work with command queues daily when I'm running video conversions. I add in 10 episodes of Battlestar in MKV, start the queue, and 20 hours later it's done, 10 episodes in more-compatible mp4! One job at a time.
